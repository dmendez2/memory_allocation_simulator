# memory_allocation_simulator
Simulates memory allocation. Program begins with one large block of free memory. As memory is allocated, the free block is partitioned into blocks of used memory and free memory. When memory is freed, a compaction algorithm checks for any neighboring free blocks and if any it will compact the holes to create the largest possible free block. Representations of memory can be accessed by a hole list or a bit map. Memory can be allocated or freed by calling the respective functions or by reading in a binary file, where the file is read using POSIX calls.
